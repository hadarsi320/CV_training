Main contributions:
* Propose to replace selective search in Fast R-CNN with region proposal networks.

Details:
* RPN architecture?
* A single gt may have more then one associated proposal from the RPN.
* 300 proposals per image.
* Bounding box regression is scale and aspect ratio dependant and not class specific, opposite of Fast R-CNN.
* Each batch has 256 anchors from 1 image, at a ratio of up to 1:1, if not enough positive, it's padded with negatives.
* NMS is ran on the output of the RPN

Previous works:
* EdgeBoxes
* OverFeat
* MultiBox

Questions:
* Alternating training?
* Approximate training?
* Cross boundry bb?
* Table 2 conclusions?
* What is recall to IoU?

Follow ups:
Q: What is the difference between train and test procedures?
During Fast R-CNN train, we apply NMS on the output of the RPN and use all resulting regions.
During inference, we apply NMS and then pick the top 300 regions for use by the Fast R-CNN.

Q: How is gt defined relative to anchors?
A: We assign a positive label to two kinds of anchors: 
(i) the anchor/anchors with the highest Intersection-over-Union (IoU) overlap with a ground-truth box, or
(ii) an anchor that has an IoU overlap higher than 0.7 with any ground-truth box. 
We assign a negative label to anchors with IoU < 0.3, and ignore the rest.
