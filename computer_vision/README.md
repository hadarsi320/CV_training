# Computer Vision (Classic)

- This sections teaches basic (classic) methods and algorithms in CV, before diving into learning methods.

### Course
 - In order to learn this subject comprehensively this section is based on udacity's introduction to computer vision [online course](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810)
 - Do the following units and problem sets:
    - Unit 1 and problem set 0
    - Unit 2  and problem set 1
    - Unit 3 (without the problem set)
    - Unit 4 and problem set 4
    - Unit 6 and problem set 5
    - Unit 7 and problem set 6
    - Unit 9,section B only  
 - For your convenience, here is some useful information:
    - The course lectures are on youtube - unfortunately not in a single playlist so no link
    - The course syllabus with links to the problem sets [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ecUGIyhYOfQPi3HPXb-7NndrLgpX_zgkwsqzfqHPaus/pubhtml)
    - In the folder "course_resources" - All the required inputs for the exercises
 - After the course, do the questions in "additional_cv_exercises", use openCV functions

### Final Exercise
 - Do an exercise that tests your computer vision skills. 
 - The task and its materials are in "final_exercise"
